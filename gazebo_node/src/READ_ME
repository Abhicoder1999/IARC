*raw_image_cap :- it captures the image from the gazebo and displays that in a window
		sub :- /mybot/camera1/image_raw

*img_pro_cal :- it does the image processing part and send the area of the contour for the part of motion calculations
		sub :- /mybot/camera1/image_raw
		pub :- /pro_img (changing this a bit kamo karibani thik se currently)

*HSV_track_bar :- You give it any topic it will give you HSV filtering GUI capacities
		sub:- the topic you wish (RGB image)

*motion_pub:- It publishes the motion for the bot so that it is at a particular distance from the object
			  according to the certain threshold with respect to the biggest area of the contour
		sub:- /pro_img
		pub:- /cmd_vel



Developement Scope:

	* Add PID Tunning to the velcoity so that at it stops at the exact point where the area become Area_Required
	* the motion of the bot causes error in rotation so do something to cancel that effect
	* It need to use PID to continue to the target point taking the central point as refference
